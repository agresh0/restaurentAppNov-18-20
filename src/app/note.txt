                ---------------------------------
        
        Basic Cammands In Angular

        1. Creating a project in Angular - ng new project-name

        2. To run Angular project - ng serve / ng serve --open

        3.To generate Component - ng c Component-name

        4. Syntax of setup path - { path:'type path',Component:}

        5.To generate service - ng g s service-name

        6.To create pipe -ng g p pipe-name

                     -Basic Concepts In Angular
        1.Module - to import 3rd party libraries - Root Module - AppModule

        2.Component - generate html,css,ts - Root Component - AppComponent

        3.to set up path for Component - use AppRoutingModule

        4.router-outlet selector - to display html in browser according to user request

        5.Angular services - Reusable code and can be shared across components

        6.Dependency Injection - to share data between dependent classes

                -Syntax: access-specifier variable-name:dependent-class-name
                -access specifier - public / private 
                -inside constructor of a class
        
        7.Asunchronous Function - observable -rxjs library
                -resolve method - subscribe()
                -reject method - catch()

        8.Data Binding - To share data within a component
                8.1 One Way Binding - Sharing done in only one direction at a time
                        8.1.1 component (ts) to view (html)
                                8.1.1.1 -String interpolation - {{property-name}} in html

                                8.1.1.2 -Property binding - [attribute-name] = "propert-name" in html

                        8.1.2 View(html) to component(ts) file

                                8.1.2.1 -Event Binding -(event-name)="function call()"

                                8.1.2.2 -Event binding using $event - (event-name)="function cal($event)"

                8.2 Two way Binding - share only in two direction at a time

                        8.2.1 ngModel - import FormsModule ,[(ngModel)]="propert-name"

        9.Angular Directive - To manipulate DOM
                        9.1 Component Directive

                        9.2 Structural Directive - to add/remove html elements based on some condition
                                                   /length of an array

                                9.2.1 *ngIf = "condition"

                                9.2.2 *ngFor = "let variable-name of array-name"

        10.Activated Route - Provides access to information about a route associated with a component 
                           that is loaded in an outlet. 

        11.ngForm - to track the form values


        pipe=ng g p 'name'
